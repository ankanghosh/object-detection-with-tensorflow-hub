Object detection with TensorFlow Hub
Object detection with TensorFlow Hub using models trained on the COCO 2017 dataset.

# About the project
Object detection with TensorFlow Hub using models trained on the COCO 2017 dataset.
This is a Google Colab notebook to demonstrate object detection on images using TensorFlow and pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. The work also explores keypoint detection and instance segmentation. To achieve this, both sample images and user-uploaded photos are processed, showcasing multiple state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. The model delivers reliable results for detection tasks.

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include TensorFlow Hub, NumPy, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, PIL, ipywidgets, and IPython.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of object detection, keypoint detection, or instance segmentation using image data and TensorFlow.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Computer Vision, particularly, object detection, keypoint detection, or instance segmentation using image data, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Hub, can clone or download the project to get started.
